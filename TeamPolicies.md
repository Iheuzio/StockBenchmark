## Issues

Issues raised with a feature board, where the feature being worked on will have a tasklist regarding the issues/missing tasks necessary to complete the feature. Upon completion, that feature on the board we will mark it as done.

## Response Delay
During week days the delay will be before the end of the next day.

During weekends depending if we agreed on working on the project beforehand, will vary between in the hour and the end of the weekend.

## Emergency
If there is something that happens the person that is concerned needs to notify the team mates through Discord or Mio ASAP.

If the person concerned does not send a message or respond to the message, the rest of the team will contact the teacher to let them know the situation.

## Agreement
We all agreed to work equally on the project.

We are all confortable to ask each other for help if needed.

We will make sure that after a meeting everyone knows what they should be working on until the next meeting.

If an emergency comes up for one of us, the rest of the team will accomodate and we will communicate as much as possible.

If we are working on a massive feature that requires more branching out into sub-features, we can split the workload to make it faster to develop. (If someone decides they are unable to complete the task, we will reconsider its priority and adjust the feature board).

If someone is stuck on a task, they will provide a concise explanation of what they did, what the issue is and how the team could integrate a solution to the problem.
